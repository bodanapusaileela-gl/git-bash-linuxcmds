git ----- global information tracking 
# What is the Version Control
-> Version control system (VCS) is a software that helps you manage changes to your code over time. 
-> It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track changes, and easily revert back to previous versions if needed. 
-> One popular VCS is Git.

# We have two version control system
-> Centralized Version Control System
-> Distributed Version Control System

# Centralized Version Control System
-> Database maintained at one site
-> If centralized system fails entire system is halted
-> Less reliable

# Distributed Version Control System
-> Database maintained at number of different sites
-> If one system fails system continues work with other 
-> More reliable

# What is git
-> Git standards for Global Information Tracker
-> Git is a distribution version control system that allow people collaborate on project

# what is git hub
-> Git hub is the remote repository hosting service and collaboration platform
-> It provide the free and paid services
-> Git having the repository

# what is repository
-> Repository having the source code data

# Git Commands
-> git init .   --> To create the local repo
-> git status  --> To check the current repository status, including change, untracked and statged files.
-> git config --global user.name <write some name> --> Config the git settings such as username and email
-> git config --global user.email <write mail id> 
-> git add .    --> Take files from untracked and modified staged to stagged stage [Untracked means newly created files][modify means if you do any change in file after commit then file it commes unstagged or modifyes staged]
-> git commit -m "somename"  (or) git commit -m .   --> Take the staged files into local repo
-> git remote[Manage the connection to remote repository such adding and remove remote]
-> git remote add <name>  -->  To add the origin name
-> git remote add origin <git hub url>  --> To add the git hub url to origin
-> git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>   --> To Rename the origin name
-> git remote remove <name>  --> To remove the origin name
-> git remote -v  --> To see list of remote
-> git log  --> To see the commit history
-> git push --> push the data from local repo to remote repo
-> git push -u origin branch name --> push the particular branch data from local repo to remote repo
-> git branch  --> To see the git branches [It is used to maintain the spearate code base is called git branch]
-> git branch <branch name>  --> To create the branch name
-> git checkout -b <branch name>  --> It create the new branch and checkout that branch
-> git checkout <branch name>   --> To shift from one branch to another branch
-> git merge <branch name>      --> [It merge the changes from one branch to another branch][It maintain the commit history]
    Merges are two types
      1) fast forward merge  --> we will merge without commit
      2) recursive       --> we will merge after commit
-> git rebase <branch name>    --> [It merge the changes from one branch to another branch][It does not mainatain the commit history]
-> git stash   --> [it save the changes from local repo to tempory location to make working directory clean]
-> git stash list  --> To see stash list
-> git stash apply --> It will take lastet file from git stash. that file wont delete in git stash when we do git stash apply
-> git stash drop  --> It will delete files in git stash 
-> git stash pop   --> It will take latest file as well as it will delete file automatically in git stash
-> git stash apply stash@{enter stash number}   --> it will take particular files from git stash
-> git stash -u    --> It moved the file into untracked stage from git stash
-> git stash branch <branch name>   --> if you want to create to separate branch with git stash files
-> git reset   --> To take the stagged file to untracked stage
-> git reset --soft HEAD~1   --> To take the commit files to untracked stage
-> git diff           --> View the difference between changes made to file
-> git clone  --> Create copy of remote repository on your local machine
-> git pull  --> It pull the data from remote repository to local repository
-> git pull <repo Url> <branch name>  --> It pull the particular branch data from remote repo to local repo
-> git clean -f <file>   --> To remove the file from untracked stage
-> git reviot  -> undoing changes to repository commit history.



# When you get below error while doing git push 
you will use below to command to seems like this master -> master
-> git fetch origin master:tmp
-> git rebase tmp
-> git push --set-upstream origin master

# If you want to push the data into Another branch
First you have to checkout from whichever branch do you want to push the data to git repo
[when you do the push to another branch master files also will come to that branch along with new files]

# It you want to merger files from one branch to another branch
you would be keep in destination place and use the git merge command. when you do the merge in terminal it wont apply in git hub
if you want to check the files ls -l

# It you want to use the pull command
when someone changes code in git hub then you will use git pull command 
Git pull command it will take code from git repo to local repo
If you want to pull changes to another branch you will use this below command keep in branch
git pull <repo Url> branch name

# What is git branch strategy
we have 5 branches
master  --> It is a Production means live env and it having existing code
feature  --> If we want to update any existing app then we will create the feature branch after complete the code update we will merge the code into master branch
release  --> Ready to delivered to the customres
Hot fix  --> If customer raise the any problem then we will create hotfix branch and we will reslove that problem. we will merge the code into master branch after reslove the problem

# What are the difference difference between new repo and new project
New repo  --> It is the part of git and git hub
New project --> It is the part of only git hub

# What is pull request
Akowledge and review the changes
It merge the changes from one branch from another branch
We can create pull request in two types
1) Pull request to repository
2) Pull request to branch within repository

# What is GubHub Project
If you want to assign any repositories project to particular person and daily get the status of the repository then you will use Project
